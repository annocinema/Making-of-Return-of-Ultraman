1
00:00:02,026 --> 00:00:03,733
Camera, start.

3
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:40,225
Did you enjoy "Return of Ultraman: MAT Arrow 1 Takeoff Order"?

4
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:44,900
Have a look at how it was shot in this making of special.

5
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:48,125
First, MAT Gyro.

6
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,200
What do you think the cockpit is made of?

7
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,150
Actually almost completely out of paper.

9
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:59,675
That's why it is being carried carefully so as to not break it.

10
00:01:00,525 --> 00:01:01,425
It's tough.

11
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:06,875
While shooting they were careful not to break it with their acting too.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,250
As you can see, the flying MAT Arrow was shot in a very unhealthy manner.

13
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,200
Look!

14
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,275
You got the eyes?

15
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:24,000
Yep.

16
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,000
It'll go out of focus!

17
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:36,025
That cockpit was also not made for the whole body, with the feet sticking outside.

18
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,325
You'd never imagine that, considering how cool it was in the film.

158
00:01:45,725 --> 00:01:47,225
Shit, a barrier?

159
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,325
Come on!

160
00:01:59,605 --> 00:02:01,225
Damnit, not enough energy!

161
00:02:01,525 --> 00:02:03,025
Ejecting the battery pack.

21
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:15,100
The command room was filmed during the heat of summer but there is only one cooling device.

22
00:02:35,725 --> 00:02:42,375
It was made without any breaks, day and night, by doing construction inside a reserved factory floor.

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:56,575
All of the command room is handmade: ceiling, walls, and floor.

24
00:02:57,175 --> 00:03:01,525
Cardboard boxes and others are brought in to complete it.

25
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,225
Captain.

183
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The nuclear weapons, at least stop the nuclear weapons.

26
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,025
There might still be survivors in Hiratsune City.

26
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,025
(Rehearsal in the finished Command Room)

27
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:12,575
Orders are to retreat, there will be no change.

28
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,100
But commander... please stop.

29
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,050
What can't you do?

31
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,000
Easy cuts, including rehearsals, were repeated over and over.

32
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:52,875
Having to shoot late at night and sleepy is quite tough.

33
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,660
But they did play around like this during rehearsals.

34
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,000
You won’t avenge your countrymen?

35
00:04:00,075 --> 00:04:02,400
Are you even human?

36
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,550
This brought the light to an end.

183
00:04:23,025 --> 00:04:25,150
The nuclear weapons, at least stop the nuclear weapons.

37
00:04:25,225 --> 00:04:26,850
There might still be survivors in Hiratsune City.

38
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,925
Ibuki might still be-

39
00:04:29,425 --> 00:04:30,850
Captain, please stop.

40
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,900
Whoa, Hayakawa, what are you doing?

41
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,000
Isn’t it obvious! I’m taking us out of level 4.

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,775
Hayakawa, stop!

44
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,200
Won't you stop?

45
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,100
Let me go.

46
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,875
Bastard!

47
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,950
Guys, don’t you understand what you’re doing?

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,300
Let go!

196
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,500
Stop this, Hayakawa!

197
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,450
This is our chance to avenge Ibuki!

50
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,125
But!

199
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,125
You won’t avenge your countrymen? Are you even human?

51
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,200
Confine him to his quarters. And keep an eye on him.

201
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Roger!

52
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,375
And just like that, the filming with this set was finished in 3 days.

53
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,375
Time to dismantle.

54
00:05:46,850 --> 00:05:52,750
The command room which took a week to be made was dismantled in just 2 hours.

55
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:41,800
The miniatures were assembled in different sizes.

56
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,625
Compare them with the size of actual people.

57
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:45,050
The small tools for the open set were also made going in and out.

58
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,750
The kaiju was also completed with many passes, all while bearing with the smell.

59
00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:05,825
Finally, the location shoot.

60
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:09,100
The place is Yonago in Tottori prefecture, the foot of Mt. Daisen.

61
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:27,725
Raise your hands.

62
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:31,075
I hate that sound.

63
00:08:49,775 --> 00:08:51,150
Preparing the film set.

64
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,175
When preparations are done,

65
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:55,375
shooting begins.

66
00:08:56,475 --> 00:08:59,5 75
The smoke is being produced by a firework called a smoke ball.

67
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:01,725
Start.

68
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:09,525
Until OK is reached, it is repeated non-stop.

70
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,375
Okay.

71
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,025
Bug Jewel also takes a rest.

72
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:58,325
Filming also happened during the night.

73
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,775
It's raining.

74
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,675
When the rain stops, filming resumes.

75
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,225
Roll it.

76
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,700
Yeah.

77
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Oh, there's a car.

78
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,325
Shooting fireworks or gunpowder can only be done once.

79
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,675
No room for failure.

162
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,900
I’m hit!

163
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Ibuki!

164
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,560
Ibuki!

80
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,425
Have a look at Ultraman's clothing.

81
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:31,425
All of the spare smoke balls caught fire!

82
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:42,575
Nevertheless, the filming continued this way.

83
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,275
This is no good.

84
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:50,750
No good.

85
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,350
Mistakes were made too.

86
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,475
But it went well most of the time.

87
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,350
Ready... Start!

88
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:29,225
Finally, the climax.

89
00:13:30,025 --> 00:13:32,575
When they tried to film Bug Jewel in the end...

90
00:13:33,625 --> 00:13:38,425
This time, it snowed.

91
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,800
Quite often unlucky.

92
00:13:47,475 --> 00:13:49,475
Well then, let's redo it.

93
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,475
Sorry.

94
00:14:00,725 --> 00:14:02,375
Camera, start.

95
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,775
Okay.

96
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,450
Somehow it was a success.

97
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,125
Great Japan for ya.

98
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:23,200
Shooting on location is finished.

99
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:24,550
Time to go back.

100
00:15:25,275 --> 00:15:26,975
Back to Osaka.

101
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:44,625
6 months actually passed since production started in the summer.

102
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:56,525
It was March of the next year when the 80-man crew returned from Yonego to Osaka, and completed Ultraman.
